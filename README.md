<h2>Tic Tac Toe Game</h2>
<p>This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in ReactJS. The game is designed to be played in the
    web browser and supports two players. It is a great project for beginners to understand the basics of game development,
    Javascript programming, and working with 2D arrays.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two-player game mode</li>
    <li>Interactive web browser interface</li>
    <li>Simple and intuitive game mechanics</li>
    <li>Clear and easy-to-understand code structure</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to play</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Start the Game:</b> Install all dependencies using "npm install" and then run the project using "npm run dev". </li>
    <li><b>Player Turns: </b>The game will prompt Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) to enter their moves alternately.</li>
    <li><b>Making a Move:</b> Players input their move by selecting desired box in a row and column.
    </li>
    <li><b>Winning the Game:</b> The game will check for a win condition after each move. A player wins by placing three of
        their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.</li>
    <li><b>Draw Condition: </b>If all nine cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.</li>
    <li><b>Restarting the Game:</b> After the game ends, players can choose to play again or exit.</li>
</ol>
